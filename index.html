                    developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure. In 2004,
                    the Indian Space Research Organisation launched
                    EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

                In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary
                education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a
                high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and
                postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly
                provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions.
                Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic
                degrees.

                The ISCED distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7
                is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8 is an advanced research
                qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of
                publishable quality based on original research.[22] The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle
                courses of requiring degree level study.
